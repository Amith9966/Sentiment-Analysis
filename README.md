The purpose is to connect the database by api to tablaeua,  then to share tablaue charts and graphs into our front end APP.   

 

If you make an API, have a database, passwords, or any data that others might use, SAVE IT to the excel 

 
**Steps **

 Excel data  create the excel tables and mock data, and get approval.  base it off the business logic.   Standardisation Excel .xlsx 

 

Postgress  add postgress into the vultr.  2  update the firewall settings as needed so we can connect into the database.    3 add tables and mock data.     Check the excel for root access 

 

make APIS  make api's so the data can be accessed  

 

 tableau  get data into tableau  

 

 

Choose an item from the above to work on and share into the front end data group chat what you will work on!   

 

 

**Project Overview Document **

**Project Title: Sentiment Analysis and Reporting on Email Data **

1. Introduction This project aims to analyze email data stored in Vultr, process it using PostgreSQL, and conduct sentiment analysis to generate insights.
